  <h1>Boston Systems Reading Group</h1>

  <p>
    A place for people to learn about <em>computer systems</em> together.
  </p>

  <p>
    Computer systems are the building blocks of applications and the fabric
    that ties them together. Databases, networks, compilers, distributed
    algorithms, virtualization, programming languages, and more.
  </p>

  <p>
    We meet weekly in Boston. Every two weeks, we pick a different topic in computer systems, read about it, and work on projects in that area.
  </p>

  <p>
    Come by even if you're not an expert! We welcome people from all backgrounds. The goal here is to learn, not to make commercial software.
