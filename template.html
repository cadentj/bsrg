  <h1>BSRG</h1>
  <p><strong>Boston Systems Reading Group</strong></p>

  <p>
    A place for people to learn about <em>computer systems</em> together.
  </p>

  <p>
    Computer systems are the building blocks of applications and the fabric
    that ties them together. Databases, networks, compilers, distributed
    algorithms, virtualization, programming languages, and more.
  </p>

  <p>
    We meet regularly in Boston. All are welcome, regardless of background.
    The goal is to learn together, not to be an expert.
